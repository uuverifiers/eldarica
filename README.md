Eldarica
========

Eldarica is a model checker for Horn clauses, Numerical Transition
Systems, and software programs. Inputs can be read in a variety of
formats, including SMT-LIB 2 and Prolog for Horn clauses, and fragments of
Scala and C for software programs, and are analysed using a variant of the
Counterexample-Guided Abstraction
Refinement (CEGAR) method. Eldarica is fast and includes sophisticated
interpolation-based techniques for synthesising new predicates for
CEGAR, enabling it to solve a wide range of verification problems.

The Eldarica C parser accepts programs augmented with various primitives
from the timed automata world: supporting concurrency, clocks, communication
channels, as well as analysis of systems with an unbounded number of
processes (parameterised analysis).

There is also a variant of Eldarica for analysing Petri nets: http://www.philipp.ruemmer.org/eldarica-p.shtml

Eldarica has been developed by Hossein Hojjat and Philipp Ruemmer,
with further contributions by Zafer Esen, Filip Konecny, and Pavle Subotic.

There is a simple **web interface** to experiment with the C interface
of Eldarica:

Documentation
-------------

You can either download a binary release of Eldarica, or compile the Scala
code yourself. Since Eldarica uses <code>sbt</code>, compilation is quite
simple: you just need <code>sbt</code> installed on your machine,
and then type <code>sbt assembly</code> to download the compiler, all
required libraries, and produce a binary of Eldarica.

After compilation (or downloading a binary release), calling Eldarica
is normally as easy as saying

  <code>./eld regression-tests/horn-smt-lib/rate_limiter.c.nts.smt2</code>

When using a binary release, one can instead also call

  <code>java -jar target/scala-2.\*/Eldarica-assembly\*.jar regression-tests/horn-smt-lib/rate_limiter.c.nts.smt2</code>

A set of examples is provided on https://eldarica.org/eldarica, and included
in the distributions directory <code>regression-tests</code>.

You can use the script <code>eld-client</code> instead of
<code>eld</code> in order to run Eldarica in a server-client mode,
which significantly speeds up processing of multiple problems.

A full list of options can be obtained by calling <code>./eld -h</code>.

The options <code>-disj</code>, <code>-abstract</code>, <code>-stac</code> can be used to control
predicate generation. For the option <code>-stac</code> to work, it is currently necessary to have Yices (version 1) installed, as this is a dependency of the Flata library.
